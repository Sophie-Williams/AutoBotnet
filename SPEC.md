All (hopefully) the details we've figured out go here.

speercs is an online multiplayer game where you program robots to build up factories and make money through trade, and compete with other competing enterprises.

## Some details of Teh Gaem

The game is played in a "map," a (not necessarily square) grid of chunks. the chunk count is theoretically infinite, but more rooms will only be generated by the server based on a random curve function to drive competition and prevent the map from getting too sparse

Chunk size: 128x128 tiles of procedurally generated terrain containing map artifacts that will be described later

## technical details

(.NET Core) Server providing dual websockets/rest api

(HTML5/JS/Vue.JS) Web UI for playing

(JS/speercslib) Language for programming robots

## Some optimistic ideas if it gets far

- VSCode extension to allow playing in VSCode
- Malware
- Economy simulation with a stock market
