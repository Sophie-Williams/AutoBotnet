all (most of) the details we've figured out go here

speercs is an online multiplayer game where you program robots to build up factories and make money through trade, and compete with other competing enterprises.

## some details of teh gaem

the game is played in a "map," a (not necessarily square) grid of rooms. the room count is technically infinite, but more rooms will only be generated by the server based on a random curve function to drive competition and prevent the map from getting too sparse

Room/"Chunk" size: 128x128
