All (hopefully) the details we've figured out go here.

speercs is an online multiplayer game where you program robots to build up factories and make money through trade, and compete with other competing enterprises.

## Some details of Teh Gaem

The game is played in a "map," a (not necessarily square) grid of chunks. the chunk count is theoretically infinite, but more rooms will only be generated by the server based on a random curve function to drive competition and prevent the map from getting too sparse

Chunk size: 128x128 tiles of procedurally generated terrain containing map artifacts that will be described later

### Resources


#### Energy

There's energy "NRG" in large but finite quantities that comes from energy drilling areas on the map. This energy is pure
and has no environemental concerns, as it is easy to extract.

#### Building

Once you have energy, you use the energy to power your robot to reach a resource mine.

Resources are (WIP):

- NRG (aforementioned pure energy)
- Iron
- Coal
- (Iron + Coal) = Steel
- Oil (Used as cheap power)
- Ethanol (More expensive but cleaner power)
- Electric batteries (These are rechargeable). They are made in factories
- Nuclear fuel cell (Obviously very efficient but also highly toxic). Requires uranium refineries. Developed in advanced factories
- Thermonuclear energy cell (Requires advanced research labs). Very expensive to make.

How it works:

You get energy, then you visit a mine and mine some iron in ore form. Then you mine some coal, and use your free
factory that you are given at spawn time to create steel and build more robots. These robots can run on NRG, which is
even more advanced than thermonuclear energy. It's basically some mystical magic energy that can only power robots for now.

Once you have more robots, you mine more resources and build even more robots. However, you will be bottlenecked by your factory,
so you build more factories (Yay Factorio!). Now you can mine other resources like oil and coal. Once you have a lot of coal,
you can use your metal to build a fossil-fuel power plant, which generates electric power. You need to build electric batteries
to store this power.

There are more advanced ship classes that can be built in higher level factories. Factories can be leveled up with NRG, fuel (coal/oil/electricity), etc.
and higher level factories can build different classes of ships that have swappable cores that can hold more resources or have more attack power.

Finally, now you have lots of powerful ships. You can build refineries that can be used to get Ethanol from a corn farm or some other crazy thing.
Then you can even level up refineries and build research labs, which require funding (yeah, scientists) and a steady supply of fuel and metal and other
resources to research things. Researching gives you research XP points, and eventually you will discover nuclear energy.

And so on.
